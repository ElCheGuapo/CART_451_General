        <div>I found Catherine D’Ignazio’s interview quite well conducted and thought-provoking. Especially her segment about oppressive forces inserting themselves in the data pipeline alongside her point of University data science courses not mandating enough ethics classes. However, I find myself disagreeing quite a bit with her segment on Big Dick Data, especially her point about these projects siphoning manpower AWAY from smaller scale, more inclusive projects. I find this ridiculous as someone who has worked freelance as a web developer and knows many people in similar situations. These “Big Dick Projects” may attract most Ph.D. graduates and highly qualified professionals. On the other hand, such a level of expertise isn’t necessarily required for these small-scale projects. In fact, nowadays we have an abundance of individuals who possess qualifications in computation who would more than eager to begin working on such small-scale projects. Hell, I study alongside these individuals. I know for a fact at least 5 people in this one, CART 451 studio class, would love to get their foot in the door of the industry (and small-scale projects like this are a great learning opportunity).
